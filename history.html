<tr><td><p>-->Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[10] It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic.[11][12] As of 27 May 2020, more than 5.59 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 350,000 deaths. More than 2.28 million people have recovered.[9]</p></td></tr>

<tr><td>-->From late January 2020 onwards a series of studies from different research teams published results ascertaining the clinical situation, and, as well providing preliminary analysis for characterizing the early evolutionary progress of SARS-CoV-2. Key technical terms in the genetic research are 'most recent common ancestor', or MRCA, and comparative studies of genomes using massive parallel sequencing or second-generation sequencing (NGS), both of which facilitated the discovery.
